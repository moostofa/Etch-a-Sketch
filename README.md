# Fill the Grid
A simple web application which challenges you to fill in the grid

# Landing page
When you fire up the webpage, you'll be greeted with a grid filled with the ðŸŽ¯ emoji. The challenge is to fill in the cells that contain the ðŸŽ¯ emoji, which you can do by hovering your cursor over.

As you move your cursor along the grid, the cells simultaneously change in colour and display a random alphabetical character.

# Reset
You can reset a grid by clicking on the blue button above it, labelled _Reset_. By resetting the grid, it returns to its original state, but this time, the cells contain the ðŸ‘» emoji instead of ðŸŽ¯.
